Welcome to Simegy Load Modelling's documentation!
===================================================

Simegy is the energy optimization framework developed by XRCE. This project deals with
building accurate load models from the power consumption data obtained from individual devices.
The main goal of this project is to explore probabilistic techniques to model the power consumption of the device.
